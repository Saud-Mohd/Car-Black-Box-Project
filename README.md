Black Box implementation in an Automotive System to log critical events. This will help in pro-active vehicle monitoring and maintenance.
The goal of this project is to implement core functionalities of a car black box in a PIC based micro-controller supported by rich peripherals. Events will be logged in EEPROM in this project.
This system allows a password based access to the transport managers to view or download the log to PC (Through UART) if required.

Technologies Used: C programming, PIC16 Microcontroller, Peripherals (Timers, LCD, ADC, EEPROM), Communication Protocols (I2C and UART), Interrupt Handling.
